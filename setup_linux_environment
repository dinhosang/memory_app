sudo gdebi <filename.deb> 

sudo apt-get

installed git - also made a new ssh and github linked to github

for node it seemed to only show legacy, had to use below to get latest version:
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash -
apt sudo-get install -y nodejs

installed node, npm, react, virtualenv, flask, mongodb

sudo service mongod start

cd to /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log to check it's working - that files also
shows connections to mongod etc. Not quite sure how to make that appear 
in the terminal instead

mongo

sudo service mongod stop
